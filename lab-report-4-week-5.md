# Researching Commands

## The Grep Command

The main purpose of the `grep` command is to search text inside a file or multiple files. This is different from `find` in that find is mostly used to look through file names themselves. 

A basic use of grep: 

```
$ grep malaria pmed.0020150.txt
        There are at least 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in
        more than a million deaths. Ninety percent of deaths due to malaria occur in Africa south
        of the Sahara, and most occur in young children. Of the four types of human malaria—
        P. malariae ,
        P. falciparum malaria is most common in Africa, and it accounts
        One recurring theme in malaria vaccine research has been the high frequency of the gene
        for sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) in malaria endemic regions, which is believed to be due to
        a heterozygote (HbAS) advantage against fatal malaria. The mechanism behind the high degree
        of resistance conferred by HbAS in severe and complicated malaria is still unknown, but
        to test whether malaria protection by HbAS has a significant immune component is to see
        whether protection varies with age. They studied the age-specific malaria pattern in 1,054
        the malaria protection provided by HbAS were innate, it should be independent of malaria
        They found that overall HbAS was nearly 40% protective against mild clinical malaria.
        The authors admit that this observation could be due to any factor that affects malaria
        malaria. For accelerated malaria-specific immunity to be relevant to HbAS selection it
        would have to operate within a period of maximum risk for severe and fatal malaria. They
        against severe malaria by HbAS was only seen in children 2–16 months old, but that in that
        malaria to protection against severe and fatal malaria are unknown, and that further work
        must be done to better understand the role of HbAS in protection against malaria.
